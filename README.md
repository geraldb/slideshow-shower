## Intro

The [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) package by Vadim Makeev bundled up into
a Slide Show (S9) template pack.

Note, the package is configured to use the following headers in `slides.html`:

    author: Your Name Here
    title: Your Slide Show Title Here
    cover: Your Slide Show Cover Image Here
    lang: Your Language Here
    theme:  ribbon|material


## Try It Yourself - How To Use the Template Pack

If you want to try it yourself, install (fetch) the new template pack. Issue the command:

    $ slideshow install shower

Or as an alternative clone the template pack using `git`. Issue the commands:

    $ cd ~/.slideshow/templates
    $ git clone https://github.com/slideshow-templates/slideshow-shower.git

To check if the new template got installed, use the `list` command:

    $ slideshow list

Listing something like:

    Installed templates include:
       shower.txt (~/.slideshow/templates/shower/shower.txt)

Now you're ready to use it using the `-t/--template` switch. Example:

    $ slideshow build tutorial -t shower

That's it.
